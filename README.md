# Persona fusion calculator

This project was based on [arantius' persona fusion calculator](https://github.com/arantius/persona-fusion-calculator). I was
bored and wrote this with Angular 7. In this new implementation, you can filter the recipes by one or more of its ingredients.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
