# Persona fusion calculator

This project was based on [arantius' persona fusion calculator](https://github.com/arantius/persona-fusion-calculator). I was
bored and wrote this with [Angular 7](https://angular.io/). In this new implementation, you can filter the recipes by one or more of its ingredients.

To run the development server or build for production, you need the Angular cli (This project used version 7.2.4).
Install it with npm:
npm install -g @angular/cli@7.2.4

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**Remember to build the dependencies first, running `npm install` in the root of the project.**

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
